Steps to Execute the Code
Google Sheets Setup:

Create three Google Sheets: Lead Form Responses, Hot Leads, and Nurturing Leads.
Populate Lead Form Responses with mock or real Google Forms data.
Google Sheets API Credentials:

Enable the Google Sheets API for your project in the Google Cloud Console.
Download the service_account.json file and place it in the same directory as the script.
Email Configuration:

Replace your_email@gmail.com and your_password with your Gmail credentials.
Allow "Less secure app access" or use an App Password for better security.
Run the Script:

Install dependencies: pip install gspread oauth2client
Execute the script: python lead_management.py


Yes, this code effectively accomplishes Task 1 as outlined in the challenge. Here's how it meets each requirement:

Requirements from Task 1
Design a lead scoring system:

The code defines a clear scoring system for each input criterion (Company Size, Budget, Industry, and Urgency of Need).
Points are assigned based on the given options and summed to calculate the lead score.
Trigger when a new form submission is received:

The script pulls data from a Google Sheets document (Lead Form Responses), which can be automatically populated by Google Forms.
Calculate the lead score:

The calculate_lead_score function computes the score based on the form inputs.
Add the lead and their score to a Google Sheets spreadsheet:

Leads are added to the Hot Leads or Nurturing Leads spreadsheet based on their score.
Send a welcome email to leads with a score above 70:

The send_email function sends a customized welcome email to high-scoring leads.
For leads with a score below 70, add a row to a different Google Sheets spreadsheet:

Low-scoring leads are added to the Nurturing Leads spreadsheet for future campaigns.
Automation Alignment
Although the script accomplishes everything, it assumes the following:

Google Forms responses are automatically stored in the Lead Form Responses Google Sheets.
It’s executed periodically or triggered manually. For real-time automation (similar to Zapier), you can:
Use a Google Apps Script trigger to execute this code whenever a new form submission occurs.
Set up a webhook for real-time processing.
Key Limitations (if any)
Real-time Execution:

Zapier provides real-time automation out of the box. This script would need additional setup (e.g., periodic cron jobs or Apps Script) to simulate that.
Error Handling:

The script does not include robust error handling for API limits, invalid emails, or unexpected data formats.
Manual Gmail Setup:

It uses Gmail credentials directly, which may require enabling "less secure app access" or setting up an App Password. A better approach would be to use OAuth2.
Next Steps for Full Integration
If periodic execution is acceptable, set up a cron job or use task schedulers like Windows Task Scheduler or Linux cron.
For real-time, trigger this script using Google Apps Script with a form submission event.

Deliverables
Updated Workflow:

The workflow is enhanced to handle incomplete data, flag high-value leads, and consider time zones.
Real-time automation can be achieved by integrating Python or Zapier steps.
Approach Explanation:

Incomplete Data: Leads with missing fields are filtered and notified.
High-Value Leads: Priority leads are flagged and routed to the sales team.
Time Zones: Communication timing is adjusted based on lead location.


Here’s how to handle Task 2: Handling Edge Cases using automation tools (Zapier or Python-based solution):

Edge Case Solutions
1. Handle Incomplete Data
Approach:

Implement a validation step during data collection.
If a lead submits incomplete data:
Send an automated follow-up email requesting the missing information.
Add the lead to a temporary Google Sheet for tracking incomplete entries.
Use Zapier or Python to check each field for completeness.
Zap Workflow:

Trigger: Google Forms submission.
Filter: Check for blank fields (Zapier's "Filter" step or a custom Python validation).
Action:
If incomplete, send an email asking for additional details.
Add the lead to a separate "Incomplete Leads" Google Sheet.
2. Ensure High-Value Leads are Properly Managed
Approach:

Define a "High-Value Lead" as one with:
Company Size: 201+ employees.
Budget: $50,001+.
Urgency: Immediate or Short-term.
Use conditional logic to flag high-value leads and notify the sales team immediately via email or Slack.
Zap Workflow:

Trigger: Google Forms submission.
Condition: Check if the lead meets "High-Value" criteria.
Action:
Add the lead to a "Priority Leads" Google Sheet.
Notify the sales team via email, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.
3. Accommodate Different Time Zones
Approach:

Use the lead’s location (via form input or IP address) to determine their time zone.
Store time zone data in the lead's record.
Automate follow-ups based on their local business hours (e.g., delay emails or tasks).
Zap Workflow:

Trigger: Google Forms submission.
Action 1: Use a "Formatter" step in Zapier to identify the time zone based on input data.
Action 2: Schedule email follow-ups or tasks based on the lead’s local time.


Task 3:
Enhancements and Approach
1. Lead Distribution Among Sales Reps
Objective: Assign leads evenly among a predefined list of sales reps to ensure balanced workload distribution.
Approach:
Maintain a list of sales reps in a Google Sheet with an "Assignment Counter."
Use Zapier's "Find Row" action to identify the next available rep (round-robin assignment).
Update the "Assigned Sales Rep" column in the lead record and increment the selected rep's counter.
2. Extract Keywords from Comments
Objective: Use Zapier's Formatter to extract keywords from the "Comments" field for basic text analysis.
Approach:
Add a "Comments" field to the Google Form.
Use the Formatter’s "Text" action in Zapier to extract keywords using predefined patterns or logic (e.g., extracting significant terms like "integration," "demo," or "pricing").
Store the extracted keywords in a "Keywords" column in the Google Sheet.
3. Create Lead Follow-Up System
Objective: Schedule reminders for the sales team in Google Calendar based on the urgency of the lead.
Approach:
Use Zapier to create an event in Google Calendar for the assigned sales rep, setting the date based on the lead's urgency:
Immediate: Schedule within 1 day.
Short-term: Schedule within 3 days.
Medium-term: Schedule within 7 days.
Long-term: Schedule within 14 days.
Zap Workflow
Zap Overview
Trigger:

Google Form submission triggers the workflow.
Lead Scoring:

Use Formatter (or Python if custom) to calculate the lead score based on input criteria.
Distribute Leads:

"Find Row" in Google Sheets to get the next available sales rep based on the round-robin method.
Update the "Assigned Sales Rep" column in the lead record and increment the rep's counter.
Keyword Extraction:

Use the Formatter to analyze the "Comments" field and extract keywords.
Update the Google Sheet with extracted keywords.
Schedule Follow-Up:

Create a Google Calendar event for the assigned sales rep, setting the due date based on urgency.
Limitations and Assumptions
Limitations:
Zapier Free Plan: Limited tasks per month might restrict scalability.
Keyword Extraction: Limited to basic pattern matching without advanced NLP capabilities.
Calendar Overload: Sales reps with many leads might find their calendar cluttered.
Assumptions:
Google Sheets stores sales reps, counters, and lead data.
Google Calendar is used for follow-ups, and all sales reps have shared access.
